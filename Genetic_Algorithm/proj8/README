Find the following files:

1. SetParams.java (creates the parameter file)
2. GetParams.java (used interally by GA.java to read the parameter file and by SetParams.java to create it)
3. params.dat (the file created by running SetParams with a specific parameter set)
4. TSPTest.java (starts the process of solving Traveling sales person)
5. GA.java (The abstract genetic algorithm)
6. WordGuess.java (The application of the GA to word guessing)
7. Pair.java (The algorithm that decides which chromosomes will be mated)
8. Mate.java (The mating algorithm)
9. start_data.txt (data for distance between cities)
10. TSP.java (Functions for the traveling sales person)

To Compile:
1. Copy all eight files to the same directory
2. Be sure that JDK is installed and accessible from the directory where the WordGuess files are found
3. Type: javac SetParams.java
4. Type: javac TSPTest.java

To create the parameter file.
1. Decide upon a parameter set, for example:
   --128 intitial population members
   --64 actural population members
   --9 number of stops for the tsp
   --.1 mutation factor
   --1000 maximum number of generations
2. Type: java SetParams params.dat 128 64 9 .1 1000

To run TSP:
1. Type: java TSPTest <parameter file> <start data file>
    For example, if the parameter file is "params.dat" and the word to be guessed is "genetic"
    java WordGuessTst params.dat start_data.txt
2. WordGuess displays the best guess from each generation until the maximum number of generations is reached.

I used top down paring and cycle crossover.
